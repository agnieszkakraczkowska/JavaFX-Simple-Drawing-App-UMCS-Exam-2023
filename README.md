# JavaFX-Simple-Drawing-App-UMCS-Exam-2023

This Java project is a simple drawing application that allows users to create and manipulate shapes on a canvas. Key features include:

- Drawing Shapes: Users can draw lines, ellipses, and rectangles on the canvas by selecting the desired shape type and specifying stroke and fill colors.

- Save and Load: The project provides functionality to save the created drawings to a CSV file and load drawings from CSV files. This allows users to preserve their work and continue editing later
